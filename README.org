* What is [[https://www.notree.io][NoTree]]?
NoTree is SaaS tool for all your needs when it comes to designing, creating, and deploying an online experiment.

It is mainly made of two parts:
- A frontend WYSIWYG tool that helps you design the experiment - both its content, style and logic.
  - The frontend is built on [[https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate][Slate]] and [[https://github.com/udecode/plate][Plate]].
- A backend that tests, builds, and deploys your experiment.
  - At this stage, the backend interprets your design to an [[https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/self/][oTree]] project. Therefore you're still bound by its license.

I'm a developer who started developing expriments in oTree in 2018.

While my full-time job is a data engineer, I enjoy creating tools like NoTree for fun and helping other people.
