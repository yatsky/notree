* What is [[https://www.notree.io][NoTree]]?
NoTree is SaaS tool for all your needs when it comes to designing, creating, and deploying an online experiment.

It is mainly made of two parts:
- A frontend WYSIWYG tool that helps you design the experiment - both its content, style and logic.
  - The frontend is built on [[https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate][Slate]] and [[https://github.com/udecode/plate][Plate]].
- A backend that tests, builds, and deploys your experiment.
  - At this stage, the backend interprets your design to an [[https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/self/][oTree]] project. Therefore you're still bound by its license.

The ultimate goal of this project is for you to design the experiment in NoTree and have it test and deploy the experiment for you.

As a starting point I intend to get the following core functionalities so that it can act solely as an oTree designer:
- [X] Design a page through the WYSIWYG editor
- [X] Insert NoTree fields into a page
- [X] User registration
  - [X] Implemented via AWS Cognito
- [-] Save/Read user data to DynamoDB
  - [X] Page level
  - [X] App level
  - [ ] Project level
- [-] Export pages
  - [-] Export pages under a generic name
    - [-] oTree-compatible Django templates
      - [ ] oTree boilerplate code
      - [X] correct HTML and fields
  - [X] Support customized page names
  - [ ] Provide a single zip file for exported pages
- [ ] Preview mode that allows anonymous users to access the app without registration and use it offline
- [ ] NoTree Field
  - [ ] Preview
    - [ ] preview for each widget type
    - [ ] preview of sensible validations
  - [ ] Validation
  - [ ] Choices

I'm a developer who started developing expriments in oTree in 2018.

While my full-time job is a data engineer, I enjoy creating tools like NoTree for fun and helping other people.
